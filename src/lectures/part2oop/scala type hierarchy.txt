                                    The parent data type is
                                         scala.Any        //all data types are derived from this type
                                            /\
                                           /  \
                                          /    \
                                         /      \
                               scala.AnyVal      scala.AnyRef
     Primitive data types extend AnyVal                 it maps to java.lang.Object class
     ex: Int, Boolean, Float, Unit                      all classes which do/do not have any parent class automatically extends
     We rarely extend this class,                       AnyRef
     mostly for memory optimisations                    example String, List, Set, user defined such as animal, person everything

                                                        ---scala.Null is derived from all the above sub classes of AnyRef
                                                        its only instance is Null reference
                                                        so any class can be replaced by Null reference

                            ---scala.Nothing is derived from all these classes (Both AnyVal and AnyRef)
                            nothing is a child class of all predefined and newly defined classes in scala
                            nothing means no defined instance at all
